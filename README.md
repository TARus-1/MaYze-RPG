# MaYze-RPG
Thank you for choosing to play Mayze. This is an RPG adventure game where you travel up a tower in order to defeat the boss and escape. 
 
You wake up to a thunderstorm outside. you're inside of an abandoned office building.  You look around, no one is there, and the windows are covered in fog.  you hear something shift near you approach and the mannequin jumps out and tries to attack you.  you quickly Dodge the attack and run down the first flight of stairs you see after which you then duck and dive into a corner.  You lie and wait, wondering if you've gone crazy until you hear something else shifting down the hallwayâ€¦

Will select your character which you can either create with stats you can allocate yourself or choose from multiple different classes with preset stats
Then you will go through the tower and each floor encountering enemies which are marked with an e, collecting items which are marked with a t, avoiding hidden traps which can I see on the map, and defeating strong enemies until you reach the third and final floor to defeat the final boss.
